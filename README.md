# CodeAlpha_Stock_Portfolio_Tracker
A simple and interactive Python-based Stock Portfolio Tracker developed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship. This project allows users to input their stock holdings, calculates the total portfolio value, provides a detailed breakdown of each stock, and optionally saves the results to a CSV file for future reference.
